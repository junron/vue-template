# Vue Template

This is a basic example of a Vue/Node/TypeScript project with annotations and comments.  
For a base template see the [master branch](https://github.com/junron/vue-template).

This project consists of a frontend and a backend. See their respective READMEs to learn more.  

[Backend](./backend/README.md)  
[Frontend](./frontend/README.md)

The two parts have not been linked yet so you only need to run one of them at a time.
